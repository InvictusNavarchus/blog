Hey, wassup? Want to hear a fun fact? I discovered the world of Data Science in May 2024. It wasn't that long, yet I already fell in love with its nature. 

I've always been a curious person; seeking the truth, exploring the unknown, and shining light on mysteries. That's why Data Science suits me perfectly. There's always mystery to explore and pattern to discover. Even a simple dataset can hide a valuable insight if you look deep enough.

That's when I decided that this is the path I'll be walking towards. Not just as a career, but as a passion. 

The path I'm walking on is vast and endless. That's why I created this blog. To document the journey that awaits me. I hope my blog can also help fellow learners who are also just starting to walk the same path.
