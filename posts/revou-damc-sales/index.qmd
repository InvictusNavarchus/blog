For the last 2 weeks, I've been learning data analysis from RevoU, on their Data Analysis Mini Course (DAMC) program. I'm not sponsored or anything, I just want to share my discovery.

First, let's load the necessary libraries. I'll use `dplyr` for data manipulation, `readr` to import the dataset, and `ggplot2.` for data visualizations.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Now, let's import the data.

```{r}
df <- read_csv('./revou_damc_case_study.csv')
```

```{r}
df
```

```{r}
str(df)
```
