# Executive Summary

## Background and Objective

Gunadarma University is one of the largest private University in Indonesia, having over 40.000 active students annually across 5 major cities. This project aims to analyze enrollment performance by comparing this year (2024) to last year (2023) enrollment data.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The data is collected by scraping student's class assignment information from Gunadarma's official website, [https://baak.gunadarma.ac.id/](https://baak.gunadarma.ac.id/#). The freshmen data were obtained by from <https://baak.gunadarma.ac.id/cariMhsBaru/>, while the sophomores were obtained from <https://baak.gunadarma.ac.id/cariKelasBaru/>. The scraping is performed by querying each letter from A-Z as the name initials.

Tools used: `Python`

| 3      | 10223027 | XXX XXX XXX | 1EA01          | 2EA04          |

### Data Cleaning

The Freshmen and Sophomores' data have slightly different columns, but not tidy enough for data analysis. Therefore, cleaning efforts were made to extrapolate information from existing columns such as `major`, `branch` , and `generation_year`. Complete report on data cleaning can be found [here](cleaning_R.html)

Tools used: `R`

### Data Analysis

The freshmen data has more data to analyze such as `branch`, and `shift`. However, for the purpose of this project, the analysis is focused on comparing enrollment rate from 2023 to 2024 by comparing the amount of students that enroll in each major.

Tools used: `R`, `Tableau`

## Results

### Top Three Majors with Largest Increase

1.  Management major has the most improvement over other majors, having nearly 200 more students compared to other majors, with Communication and Accountant follow closely behind.
2.  Meanwhile, Computer Science has the most decrease over other majors, having over 100 less students.

## Recommendations

1.  Further research should be conducted to explore the factors affecting the rise of management major, and factors affecting the reduce in computer science.
2.  Students and Lecturers are great source of information. Including them in further research such as giving surveys and conducting interviews would be a great way to aid analysis.
