# Executive Summary

## Objective

The goal of this analysis is to find **common characteristics** among the **most popular movies**. These characteristics would be helpful to potential **movie producers** who wants to identify trends and patterns that contribute to a film's success.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The data was collected from [IMDB Non-Commercial Dataset](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/), which are freely available to the public.

### Data Cleaning

The dataset is given as a list of `.tsv` files. To process that, I setup a local SQLite database with appropriate tables and imported the `.tsv` into them.

The dataset contains a comprehensive amount of data, with a total of 39 columns that are spread across of 7 tables. For this analysis, I selected 2 tables that are most relevant and joined them together: `title.basics` and `title.ratings.`

To get the most popular movies, I sorted the movies descendingly based on the number of votes, as it should be positively correlated with the amount of people that watched the movie.

Finally, I took the top 10.000 rows and export them into a `.csv` file.

The `csv` file is then loaded into R to check for data quality and for further analysis. The data is already clean. The data reflects what the live site shows, with 0,01% null values, no duplicates, no misspellings, and so on.

### Data Analysis

The analysis is also performed using R in RStudio, with the help of `tidyverse` libraries such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2.` The majority of the analysis is identifying relationships among the number of votes and the potential key variables using statistics and visualization.
