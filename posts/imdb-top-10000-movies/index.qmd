# Executive Summary

## Objective

The goal of this analysis is to find **common characteristics** among the **most popular movies**. These characteristics would be helpful to potential **movie producers** who want to identify trends and patterns that contribute to a film's success.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The data was collected from the [IMDb Non-Commercial Dataset](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/), which is freely available to the public.

### Data Cleaning

The dataset is given as a list of `.tsv` files. To process that, I set up a local SQLite database with appropriate tables and imported the `.tsv` into them.

The dataset contains a comprehensive amount of data, with a total of 39 columns that are spread across 7 tables. For this analysis, I selected 2 tables that are most relevant and joined them together: `title.basics` and `title.ratings.`

To get the most popular movies, I sorted the movies in descending order based on the number of votes, as it should be positively correlated with the amount of people that watched the movie.

Finally, I took the top 10.000 rows and exported them into a `.csv` file.

The `csv` file is then loaded into R to check for data quality and for further analysis. The data is already clean. The data reflects what the live site shows, with 0.01% null values, no duplicates, no misspellings, and so on.

### Data Analysis

The analysis is also performed using R in RStudio, with the help of `tidyverse` libraries such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2.` The majority of the analysis is identifying relationships among the number of votes and the potential key variables using statistics and visualization.

## Results

```{r}
#| output: false

library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv('top_10_000_movies.csv', na = '\\N')
df <- df |> 
  mutate(genres = fct_rev(fct_infreq(genres)))
df_unnested_genre <- df |> 
  mutate(genres = str_split(genres, ',')) |> 
  unnest_longer(genres) |> 
  mutate(genres = fct_rev(fct_infreq(genres)))
```

### Most Common Movie Duration

```{r}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(runtimeMinutes)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = runtimeMinutes >= 80 & runtimeMinutes <= 120), 
                 binwidth = 40, boundary = 0, na.rm = TRUE) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 240, 40)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("FALSE" = "grey", "TRUE" = "#FFA07A")) +
  labs(fill = "",
       title =  "Most Common Movie Duration",
       subtitle = '73% of Movies are between 80-120 minutes long',
       x = 'Movie Duration',
       y = 'Total Movies') +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```
The most popular movies have *moderate* duration, which is *80-120 minutes*, and very few of them are below 80 minutes. This suggests that most audience prefer movies with *long enough* duration to build depth, characters, plots, and other aspects; But not *too long.*

### Most Common Genre Combinations

```{r}
df |> 
  count(genres) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  mutate(is_top3 = ifelse(row_number() <= 3, "Top 3", "Others")) |>  # Flag top 5
  slice_head(n = 10) |> 
  ggplot(aes(n, genres, fill = is_top3)) +  # Use fill aesthetic to differentiate
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(is_top3 == "Top 3", n, "")), hjust = 1.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Top 3" = "#FFA07A", "Others" = "grey")) +  # Highlight top 5
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(fill = "Rank",
       title = 'Most Common Genre Combinations',
       subtitle = 'Comedy + Drama + Romance becomes number #1 combination',
       x = 'Total Movies',
       y = 'Genres') +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```
Each movie can have multiple genres. The most popular ones are the one that has Drama, Comedy, and Romance altogether. This suggests that audience prefer movies that are *easy to relate*.

### Most Common Genres

```{r}
df_unnested_genre |> 
  count(genres) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  slice_head(n = 10) |> 
  mutate(Rank = if_else(row_number() <= 3, 'Top 3', 'Others')) |> 
  ggplot(aes(genres, n, fill = Rank)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(Rank == "Top 3", n, "")), hjust = 1.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('Top 3' = '#FFA07A', 'Others' = 'grey')) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = 'Most Common Individual Genres',
       subtitle = 'The top three genres are Drama, Comedy, and Action',
       y = 'Total Movies',
       x = 'Genres') +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

If we count each genre separately, we'll see that *Drama* dominated the genre competition across top 10.000 movies. A possible explanation is because it's one of the most *flexible* element. It can be applied to any kind of movies, and will relate to anyone across times and cultures.

## Recommendations

1.  **Aim for a movie duration between 80-120 minutes**: The data shows that 73% of the most popular movies fall within this range. This suggests audiences prefer movies of moderate length.

2.  **Focus on key genre combinations**: Consider producing movies that combine Comedy, Drama, and Romance, as this was the most common genre combination. Alternatively, pure Drama movies or Comedy-Drama combinations were also highly popular.

3.  **Prioritize Drama, Comedy, and Action genres**: When considering individual genres, these three were the most common among popular movies. Producers might want to ensure their projects incorporate at least one of these genres.
