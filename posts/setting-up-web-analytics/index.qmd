As a blogger about data analysis, it would be strange to not setup web analytics, as it'll be a valuable data source for analysis.

## Setup

Fortunately, with Quarto, the setup is simple. Here is an excerpt taken from the [docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html#google-analytics):

> You can add [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) to your website by adding adding a `google-analytics` key to your `_quarto.yml` file. In its simplest form, you can just pass your Google Analytics tracking Id (e.g. `UA-xxxxxxx`) or Google Tag measurement Id (e.g. `G-xxxxxxx`) like:
>
> ``` yaml
> website: 
>   google-analytics: "UA-XXXXXXXX"
> ```

However, there is another analytics I want to use alongside with Google Analytics: Statscounter. It's only free for 500 visitors, but the report is much cleaner and easier to understand than Google Analytics's.

Unfortunately, Quarto doesn't natively support it, so we have to go by the usual installation method: code insertion, precisely before

<body>

on every page.

I tried to look about it on the [website-tools](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html) page of the [docs](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/), but I couldn't find it. Maybe someone else made it as an [extension](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/)? Nope, not there either.

So, I Googled it and found someone [asked a similar question](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/4179). There, I found the answer. It turned out Quarto natively supports text/file insertion, which i could use for code insertion. It's on the [html-basics](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) page of the docs, right on the [#includes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#includes) section. It's located at the very bottom of the page, that's probably why I missed it.

Now, the `_publish.yaml` looks something like this:

``` yaml
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: cosmo
      dark: darkly
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
    include-in-header: 
      - text: |
            <!-- Default Statcounter code for Invictus Quarto https://invictus.quarto.pub -->
            <script type="text/javascript">
            // actual script goes here
            </script>
            <!-- End of Statcounter Code -->
```

We're almost done here. There is only one thing left: Cookie Consent.

Yup, we don't want to collect user's data without their permission. Fortunately, Quarto also natively supports this. We just to toggle it on.

``` yaml
website:
  cookie-consent: true
```

## Testing 

Now let's fire up the server and make sure if the scripts are loaded.

Now, let's see what happens when we turn off tracking cookie preference.

Now the script becomes `text/plain`, effectively disabling it. That's neat.

## Closing

With that, our web analytics setup is done. Ideally, we should setup Privacy Policy as well. We'll do that some other time. For now, the cookie banner notice is enough
